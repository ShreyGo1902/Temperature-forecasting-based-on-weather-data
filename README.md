# Temperature-forecasting-based-on-weather-data 

The datset consists of 14 year data of Temperature , Pressure ,	Relative , Humidity , Snow Depth , Wind Direction and	Wind Speed. The readings are on 30 minutes basis . The factors which will affect temperature amongst these are chosen . All of them are regarded as 'features' and temperature readings are 'label' . The testing data consists of 3 days from the month of May in 15th year. Temperature is predicted based on the feature values of these days . 

When the actual temperature readings are calculated , the predicted and actual are plotted simultaneously using matplotlib to show the small difference between the two.
